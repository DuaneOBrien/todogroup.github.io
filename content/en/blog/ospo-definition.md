The TODO Group is [over 5 years old](https://todogroup.org/blog/welcome/) and as an organization have brought together the brightest in the field of open source program management. We have produced a variety of open source program management [guides](https://todogroup.org/guides/), [tools](https://github.com/todogroup/repolinter), [surveys](https://github.com/todogroup/survey) and even an [awesome list](https://github.com/todogroup/awesome-oss-mgmt) to advance the practice.

Today, we are formalizing the [definition](https://github.com/todogroup/ospodefinition.org) of what an open source program (colloquially an OSPO) is based on our years of experience and to ensure we have a common lexicon in the industry when we describe open source programs:

*An open source program office (OSPO) is designed to be the center of competency for an organization's open source operations and structure. This can include setting code use, distribution, selection, auditing and other policies, as well as training developers, ensuring legal compliance and promoting and building community engagement that benefits the organization strategically.*

The full detailed OSPO definition and more resources on [GitHub](https://github.com/todogroup/ospodefinition.org) and available anyone to reference. At the end of the day, each OSPO is custom-configured based on its particular business, products and goals.
